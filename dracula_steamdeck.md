# How to Fix a Steam Deck Stuck on "Verifying Installation"

*Greetings, weary traveler of the digital crypt…*

When your Steam Deck fails to rise from the grave and instead lingers forever at the "Verifying Installation" screen, fear not! Follow these eldritch steps to reanimate your device without sacrificing your precious game data (or your sanity).

## 1. Check Your Power and Connection

**The Curse of the Empty Battery:**  
Even Dracula needs a full coffin to rest.  
- **Charge your device fully:** Plug it into the official charger and let it sip that lifeblood (power) until full.

**The Internet's Life Force:**  
The Steam Launcher demands a connection to the netherworld (internet) to complete its rites.
- **Connect to Wi-Fi or Ethernet:** If possible, tether your mobile device or connect via a dock with Ethernet. As some wizards have discovered, a proper connection might break the cycle of endless verification.

## 2. Reboot with Ritualistic Precision

Sometimes, the magic simply needs to be reset:
- **Hard Reboot:** Hold down the power button for 10 seconds to force a shutdown.
- **Boot Manager Invocation:** Upon restart, hold the “...” button along with power to enter the boot manager. From here, try selecting a previous OS image (often labeled "Previous" or "A/B Partition"). This might allow your Deck to boot using an older, more stable incantation.

*Tip: If selecting a previous image works, your Deck may boot into an older version, giving you a temporary reprieve to update settings or connect to a stable network.*

## 3. Boot into Desktop Mode to Bypass the Curse

When all else fails, bypass the haunted Steam Launcher:
1. **Access Console Mode:**  
   - During boot, try pressing **Ctrl+Alt+F3** to open a terminal.
2. **Enter Chroot if Possible:**  
   - If you have access via a USB recovery image, run:
     ```bash
     sudo ./tools/repair_device.sh chroot
     ```
3. **Disable Read-Only Mode and Switch Sessions:**  
   - Within the chroot, execute:
     ```bash
     steamos-readonly disable
     steamos-session-select plasma-persistent
     ```
   This forces your Deck to boot into the mysterious KDE Plasma desktop, bypassing the cursed Steam launcher. Once in desktop mode, you can update and adjust your settings manually.

*Warning: This is an arcane workaround. Use only if you’re comfortable with Linux commands, lest you risk deeper enchantments upon your device.*

## 4. When All Else Fails… Sacrifice (Without Losing Your Soul)

If none of these rites work, your final recourse is to reimage the Steam OS. Before doing so:
- **Backup Your Precious Data:** Make sure cloud saves and non-Steam game data are secured.
- **Follow Valve's Official Recovery Rituals:** Search for “Steam Deck Recovery” on Valve’s support pages or trusted forums.

## Final Words from the Crypt

Remember, dear user, that the Steam Deck is a powerful but temperamental beast. Sometimes its dark magic demands patience and the right incantations (or even a good Ethernet connection) to break the cycle of endless verification. Should you find yourself forever haunted by this error, consider sticking with stable updates rather than risking the unpredictable beta.

May your boot process be swift and your gaming sessions eternal.

*Happy haunting and gaming, my dark apprentice!*
