# When We Fall Asleep: A Metaphysical Exploration

Sleep takes us to the borderlands between consciousness and void, where reality dissolves into something more fluid, more primal. When we surrender to sleep, where exactly do "we" go?

## The Neurological Theater: Beyond the Conventional Model

The conventional neuroscientific model presents sleep as a series of brain states orchestrated by neurochemical shifts. But what if we're missing something fundamental?

Recent research has uncovered peculiar phenomena that challenge our understanding of consciousness during sleep:

### Quantum Neural Correlates

Some theoretical physicists and neuroscientists have proposed that consciousness may operate at the quantum level through microtubules within neurons. During sleep, especially REM sleep, these quantum-coherent states might achieve greater degrees of freedom from classical constraints. The Penrose-Hameroff "Orchestrated Objective Reduction" (Orch OR) theory suggests that quantum computations in microtubules might temporarily decouple from normal space-time constraints during sleep.

### DMT and Endogenous Psychedelics

The pineal gland has been found to produce N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a powerful endogenous psychedelic compound. DMT levels surge during deep sleep and near-death experiences. This neurochemical, sometimes called "the spirit molecule," creates experiences so profoundly different from normal consciousness that they've been described as journeys to alternate dimensions.

What if our brains are not just shutting down during sleep but actively producing compounds that temporarily relocate our consciousness to entirely different experiential realms? The striking similarities between DMT experiences and certain dream states suggest a neurochemical mechanism for consciousness displacement.

### Default Mode Network Dissolution

During normal waking consciousness, the Default Mode Network (DMN) maintains our sense of self-identity and narrative continuity. During sleep, particularly deep sleep and REM sleep, this network undergoes radical reorganization. fMRI studies show bizarre connectivity patterns emerging during dreams that have no parallel in waking life.

This neural reorganization could represent not a degradation of consciousness but a transition to alternative forms of consciousness with different organizational principles. When the DMN dissolves, does "you" as you know yourself dissolve with it, allowing some more fundamental aspect of consciousness to emerge?

### Brain Electromagnetic Field Theories

Some neuroscientists propose that consciousness arises not directly from neural firing but from the electromagnetic fields generated by synchronized neural activity. During sleep, these fields undergo dramatic changes in frequency, amplitude, and coherence.

The electromagnetic field theory of consciousness raises intriguing questions: Could these fields temporarily detach from their neural generators during deep sleep? Could they interact with fields beyond the body? Some researchers speculate about non-local quantum field effects that might allow consciousness to expand beyond its usual boundaries during sleep states.

## The Dream Dimension

Perhaps sleep transports our consciousness to some parallel dimension where the laws of physics and logic hold no jurisdiction. A realm constructed from memory fragments, emotional residue, and archetypal patterns buried deep within our collective unconscious.

    '==============================='
       CONSCIOUSNESS UNMOORED
```

In dreams, we witness impossible geometries and nonsensical narratives that nonetheless feel profound. We experience emotions with unusual intensity. We revisit places long forgotten in waking life or construct elaborate worlds that never existed at all.

What if dreams aren't merely the brain's maintenance cycle but glimpses into alternative realities? What if consciousness, freed from sensory input, can access states of existence typically hidden from us?

## The Small Death

The ancient Romans called sleep "the small death" (*mors minor*). When we sleep, we experience a temporary cessation of self-awareness - a nightly rehearsal for our eventual non-existence. We surrender control, we lose our grip on identity, we drift into a void.

Yet unlike death, we return. And in that returning, we experience something remarkable - the reconstitution of self, the rebuilding of identity from scattered components. Each morning, we perform the miracle of resurrection, piecing ourselves back together from the fragments of yesterday.

## The Collective Ocean

Some traditions suggest that in sleep, particularly deep dreamless sleep, individual consciousness dissolves back into a universal consciousness - like a drop of water temporarily rejoining the ocean. The boundaries of self soften and merge with something larger.

In this view, sleep isn't just rest but communion - a nightly return to source, a brief reunion with the unified field of consciousness from which we emerged at birth and to which we may return at death.

## Beyond the Neural: Strange Borderlands

What if the boundary between "in the body" and "out of the body" isn't as clear-cut as we assume? Several neurological anomalies suggest consciousness might operate in ways that transcend simple localization:

### Glial Syncytium and Distributed Cognition

While neurons get all the glory, glial cells—particularly astrocytes—form a vast interconnected syncytium throughout the brain. This syncytium operates on slower timescales than neural firing but processes immense amounts of information. During sleep, astrocytic activity changes dramatically, potentially accessing information processing modes unavailable during wakefulness.

Some researchers propose that this glial network might serve as an interface between classical neural processing and more exotic forms of information processing, possibly even connecting to theoretical "morphic fields" or other non-local information structures.

```

### Biophotons and Optical Communication

Neurons emit ultra-weak photons (biophotons) during activity. These biophotons may constitute a completely separate communication system running parallel to electrochemical signaling. During sleep, particularly deep sleep, biophoton emission patterns change significantly.

Could these biophotons form the basis of a quantum optical communication network within the brain that interfaces with external fields during sleep? Some researchers speculate that microtubules within neurons might function as waveguides for these photons, creating quantum-coherent information states that could potentially extend beyond normal space-time constraints.

### Holographic Brain Theory and Memory Access

Karl Pribram's holographic brain theory suggests that memories aren't stored locally but distributed throughout the brain in interference patterns similar to holograms. During sleep, particularly during dream states, these holographic patterns might be accessed and reconstructed in ways fundamentally different from waking recall.

If consciousness is itself a holographic phenomenon, could sleep allow access to aspects of the hologram normally filtered out during waking consciousness? Could we be accessing not just our own holographic patterns but connecting to larger informational fields?

### Temporal Lobe Portal Hypothesis

The temporal lobes, particularly active during dreaming, are associated with mystical experiences, out-of-body sensations, and feelings of presence. Some neuroscientists have proposed that certain temporal lobe states might function as "portals" that allow consciousness to access information or modes of being not normally available.

During sleep, enhanced activity in specific temporal lobe circuits combined with pineal secretions and altered thalamic filtering might create the perfect neurological conditions for consciousness to temporarily operate according to different rules or even in different domains altogether.

## Astral Journeys: The Wandering Self

Many traditions across human history have suggested that sleep represents not just a change in consciousness but an actual departure - that some essential part of us leaves the physical body to travel in other realms. From ancient Egyptian concepts of the "ka" and "ba" to indigenous shamanic practices to modern accounts of astral projection, this idea persists across cultures.

```

        (   )

        /   \                 
       /     \                
      /       \               
     /         \              
    /           \             
   /             \            
  /               \           
 /                 \          
(___________________) 
      SILVER CORD
```

In these traditions, the sleeping body remains as an anchor, often connected to the traveling consciousness by a "silver cord" or similar energetic tether. The consciousness itself may journey to ancestral realms, future possibilities, or non-physical dimensions populated by other entities.

What if these experiences are not merely symbolic or hallucinatory but represent genuine metaphysical travel? What if consciousness is not generated by the brain but merely channeled through it, capable of independent existence when the brain's control is temporarily relaxed in sleep?

## The Unanswerable Question

The skeptical perspective holds that we don't go anywhere when we sleep - rather, the "we" temporarily ceases to exist. The narrative thread of self-consciousness that we mistake for our essential being simply pauses, and the underlying processes continue without the observer.

Sleep reminds us that consciousness is not a constant but a fluctuating state. The "I" that asks where we go during sleep is itself impermanent, constructed anew each morning from biological processes and accumulated memories.

Perhaps the most profound insight sleep offers is this glimpse of non-existence that doesn't frighten us - this nightly surrender to oblivion that we not only accept but crave. In sleep, we find evidence that we can cease to be and yet return, that consciousness can be interrupted without being destroyed.

And in that paradox lies a strange comfort about the greater mystery that awaits us all.

DREAMING OF ELSEWHERE
```

Perhaps the most compelling evidence for the idea that "we" leave our bodies during sleep comes not from scientific measurement but from the subjective experience itself. The vivid sense of presence in dreams, the occasional awareness that one is dreaming (lucid dreaming), and the rare but documented cases of shared dreams between individuals all hint at something more complex than mere neural simulation.

If consciousness can exist - even briefly and partially - independent of the brain during sleep, what implications might this have for our understanding of consciousness itself? Could sleep be not just a metabolic necessity but a glimpse into the true nature of consciousness as something not bound to physical form?

The question of where we go when we sleep may ultimately be inseparable from the larger questions: What is consciousness? What is the self? And what, if anything, persists beyond the dissolution of the body?

## Neurological Liminal States: The Weird Zone

Between wakefulness and sleep lie hypnagogic and hypnopompic states—twilight zones of consciousness where the boundaries between "in" and "out" of body become particularly porous:

```
W─────────H─────────N1─────N2─────N3─────REM
│         │                               │
awake     hypnagogia                 hypnopompia
```

### Hypnagogic Geometry and Dimensionality Shifts

During hypnagogia (the transition into sleep), many people report perceiving impossible geometric forms and experiencing spatial distortions. These aren't merely hallucinations but may represent consciousness briefly perceiving reality through different dimensional frameworks.

Neurologically, this correlates with the breakdown of conventional 3D spatial mapping in the parietal cortex combined with altered activity in the claustrum, a thin sheet of neurons that has been called a potential "seat of consciousness."

### Consciousness Bifurcation Hypothesis

Some researchers propose that during certain sleep states, particularly lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis, consciousness actually bifurcates—part remains associated with the physical body while part detaches to operate independently.

This bifurcation might explain how some lucid dreamers can simultaneously be aware of their sleeping physical body and their dream body in a completely different experiential realm. The neurological correlate could involve split synchronization between different thalamo-cortical loops, creating parallel processing streams of consciousness.

### The Consciousness Reception Model

A minority view in neuroscience suggests the brain might function more like a receiver than a generator of consciousness—similar to how a television receives but doesn't create the signal it displays.

During wakefulness, the brain may be tuned to very specific frequencies of consciousness associated with physical reality. During sleep, this tuning shifts dramatically, potentially allowing consciousness to receive information from entirely different "channels" or planes of existence.

The radical frequency shifts observed in brain activity during different sleep stages might represent this retuning process as consciousness temporarily disengages from physical reality-processing and connects to other information fields or dimensions.

Sleep, that strange borderland between being and non-being, continues to whisper its mysteries to us each night, whether we remember them in the morning or not—and the neurological evidence suggests these mysteries may be far stranger and more profound than we've dared to imagine.
