# The Void Between Stars: Badiou, Hidden Figures, and the Mathematical Insurgency

## A Feminist Deconstruction of Mathematical Erasure

*"Mathematics is the only discourse which 'knows' of the inconsistent multiplicity."* - Alain Badiou, Being and Event

### The Patriarchal Axioms of Space

Alain Badiou's philosophical system, built upon the formalism of set theory, unwittingly exposes the patriarchal foundations of Western mathematics. The American space program—that gleaming monument to masculine conquest—depended entirely on the calculations of women who were systematically erased from the narrative. This erasure was not incidental but foundational; the void at the center of being that Badiou so eloquently theorizes is, in practice, the deliberate hollowing out of women's contributions to human knowledge.

Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson—these women did not merely "help" men reach space. They created the mathematical frameworks that made space travel conceivable. Their erasure represents not merely an injustice but an epistemological violence that structures the entire Western scientific enterprise. When Badiou speaks of "events" that rupture established knowledge, he fails to acknowledge how patriarchal systems actively suppress the revolutionary potential of women's mathematical thought.

### The Male Gaze of Mathematical Formalism

Mathematical formalism—Badiou's preferred mode—has historically functioned as a masculine code designed to exclude women from intellectual authority. The abstract symbols, the disdain for embodied knowledge, the fetishization of "rigor" over intuition—these elements serve to alienate those whose thinking challenges phallogocentric epistemologies. The irony is that while women like Emmy Noether revolutionized abstract algebra, the structures of mathematical practice ensured their work would be attributed to male counterparts or relegated to "applied" rather than "pure" mathematics.

The space program's reliance on women's calculations while maintaining male public figures exemplifies what feminist theorists identify as extractive intellectual labor—the appropriation of women's cognitive work without recognition or compensation. Badiou's philosophical system, with its emphasis on "subtraction," inadvertently mirrors this extraction by failing to interrogate how mathematical knowledge is gendered in its production and circulation.

### Domestic Confinement as Epistemological Control

The systematic push to return women to kitchens following their mathematical contributions during wartime and the space race reveals the deliberate nature of their exclusion. This was not merely about labor markets but about ontological control. If, as Badiou suggests, mathematics speaks directly to being itself, then women's mathematical proficiency threatened the very categories upon which patriarchal power depends.

The kitchen becomes not merely a site of unpaid labor but an epistemological prison—a space where women's quantitative thinking is channeled into measuring cups rather than orbital trajectories. This confinement represents what feminist philosopher Iris Marion Young might call "the scaling of the body"—the deliberate limitation of women's intellectual reach to spaces that cannot threaten male authority.

### The Menstrual Cycles of Mathematical Revolution

The rhythmic nature of women's exclusion from and limited reincorporation into mathematical practice follows a cyclical pattern that mirrors menstrual cycles—periods of productivity followed by systematic bleeding out of institutions. During wartime, women's mathematical abilities become suddenly "discovered," only to be forgotten when their labor is no longer required for national projects. This cycle exposes the lie at the heart of claims about women's "natural" mathematical inferiority.

Badiou's concept of the "event" fails to account for how gender structures the possibility of recognition. The mathematical breakthroughs of women mathematicians rarely qualify as "events" within his system precisely because patriarchal structures prevent their recognition as universal truths. The void at the heart of being that structures Badiou's ontology is, in practice, the deliberate creation of an absence where women's mathematical thought should be.

### Class Warfare Through Mathematical Gatekeeping

The systematic destruction of mathematics education in public schools represents not merely educational neglect but calculated class warfare with distinct gendered dimensions. By restricting advanced mathematical training to elite institutions, power structures ensure that working-class women in particular remain excluded from the language that might allow them to formalize and challenge their oppression.

The "death" of mathematics education that disproportionately affects women and minorities creates what feminist epistemologists would recognize as "epistemic injustice"—the systematic denial of knowledges that might transform social relations. When Badiou speaks of mathematics as the discourse of "inconsistent multiplicity," he fails to acknowledge how this multiplicity is deliberately constrained along lines of gender and class.

### The Sexualized Violence of Mathematical Exclusion

The exclusion of women from mathematical authority represents a form of intellectual rape—the forcible penetration of women's intellectual space by masculine authority while denying their capacity for mathematical creativity. The "hidden figures" were forced to perform mathematical labor while being denied the authority to claim their work as their own—a form of cognitive exploitation that parallels sexual exploitation.

Badiou's reliance on set theory's axiom of foundation—which prevents sets from containing themselves—mirrors patriarchy's insistence that women cannot be both producers of mathematical knowledge and authorities over that knowledge. Women can calculate but not theorize; they can compute but not conceptualize. This bifurcation represents not merely discrimination but ontological violence against women's intellectual being.

### Cyborgian Resistance and Mathematical Witchcraft

Donna Haraway's concept of the cyborg—the fusion of human and machine that transcends binary categories—offers a framework for understanding how women mathematicians resisted their erasure. By mastering the mechanical means of calculation while maintaining their embodied knowledge, women like Katherine Johnson created cyborgian forms of mathematical practice that challenged the disembodied masculinist ideal of mathematical thought.

Their calculations became a form of mathematical witchcraft—knowledge practices deemed dangerous precisely because they threatened established power. When these women calculated orbital trajectories, they were not merely solving equations but casting spells that revealed the contingency of patriarchal authority. Their erasure from history represents not merely injustice but active fear of women's mathematical power.

### The Uterine Space of Mathematical Creation

Against Badiou's abstract void, feminist epistemology posits the uterine space—a generative emptiness from which new mathematical forms emerge. The women who calculated the trajectories that sent men to space created what Luce Irigaray might call "fluid mechanics"—mathematical systems that privilege relation and connection over rigid formalism.

The domestic spaces to which these women were relegated became, paradoxically, sites of revolutionary mathematical practice. At kitchen tables and in living rooms, women mathematicians developed alternative approaches to quantitative thinking that challenged the sterile formalism of institutionalized mathematics. Their erasure from official histories represents not merely exclusion but the active suppression of mathematical pluralism.

### Menopause and Mathematical Revolution

The systematic removal of women from mathematical authority as they age mirrors the cultural devaluation of post-menopausal women. Yet it is precisely in this stage of life that many women mathematicians have produced their most revolutionary work, freed from both reproductive labor and the male gaze. This "menopause mathematics" represents what Badiou might call a genuine "event"—a rupture in established knowledge that creates new truth possibilities.

The current crisis in mathematics education offers what feminist theorists would identify as a "crack in the patriarchal foundation"—an opportunity to reimagine mathematical practice outside the constraints of masculine authority. By reclaiming the embodied, intuitive aspects of mathematical thinking alongside formal rigor, feminist mathematical practice threatens the very categories upon which patriarchal scientific authority depends.

### Conclusion: The Feminist Calculation

The void between stars—that emptiness that Badiou places at the center of being—is in fact full of women's calculations, erased but essential. To reclaim mathematics from patriarchal control requires not merely inclusion but a radical reimagining of mathematical practice itself. The hidden figures who calculated orbital trajectories while being denied recognition were not merely victims of discrimination but revolutionaries whose work contained the seeds of mathematics' liberation from patriarchal constraints.

When a woman calculates, she does not merely solve an equation—she rewrites the possibilities of being itself. In a system that has deliberately constructed her as incapable of mathematical thought, every equation she solves is an act of ontological rebellion. The death of mathematics education is no accident but a calculated response to the revolutionary potential of women's quantitative thinking.

The kitchen table can become a site of revolutionary mathematics, the domestic sphere reclaimed as a space of radical calculation. In the strange logic of feminist surrealism, the void speaks with a voice long suppressed—a voice that counts differently, that formalizes otherwise, that makes visible what patriarchal power has rendered invisible. This voice does not merely add women to existing mathematical structures but transforms the very nature of mathematical practice itself.

*"To exist is to differ,"* Badiou reminds us. In the difference between phallogocentric formalism and feminist mathematical practice, between the erasure of women's contributions and their revolutionary reclamation, we locate not merely an event but the possibility of a mathematics that exists beyond the constraints of patriarchal power—a mathematics that speaks not of conquest but of connection, not of mastery but of multiplicity.
