# Hypergraph + Deltas + MindsDB

This repository demonstrates how to implement a **hypergraph + event-sourcing** style data model in **PostgreSQL**, with a Node.js application layer and optional **MindsDB** integration. The core idea:  
- **Entities** are stored in a table, each with a JSONB field for metadata.  
- **Deltas** (events) are appended to a log, describing each change over time.  
- By replaying these deltas, you can reconstruct the full or final state of any entity at any point in time.  

With **MindsDB**, you can **train predictive models** directly from your `deltas` table (and beyond), enabling advanced analysis of user behavior, deposits, relationships, or any other event data.

## Background & Concepts

1. **Hypergraph**  
   - Unlike a normal graph, hypergraphs allow “edges” (hyperedges) that connect multiple nodes at once. This is useful when an event or relationship involves more than two entities.

2. **Deltas (Event Sourcing)**  
   - Each change to an entity is stored as an immutable event (“delta”) in a log.  
   - You can replay these deltas chronologically to reconstruct state at any time.  
   - This approach is similar to Datomic, CQRS, or any event-sourcing architecture.

3. **MindsDB**  
   - A machine learning platform that **runs inside Postgres** (or other databases).  
   - You can create **predictors** that learn from your `deltas` table, making it easy to forecast future deltas, amounts, user behaviors, etc., **all within SQL**.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)  
- **Postgres** installed and running, with a user/database set up:
  - Example: database `mydb`, user `myuser`, password `mypassword`.
- **MindsDB** installed in your Postgres environment (optional but **highly recommended**).  
  - Typically:  
    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS mindsdb;
    ```
